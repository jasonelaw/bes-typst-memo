This is a quarto memo template for a [Typst](https://typst.app) document. It's
fast and makes really pretty documents. 

 ```{=typst}
 #lorem(300)
 ```
 
You can also include code chunks and graphics like this:
```{r}
plot(Formaldehyde$carb, Formaldehyde$optden, ylab = "", xlab = "")
```
 
 ```{=typst}
 #lorem(100)
 ```

 Why?

Can I really include equations in line ` $E = m C^2$ `{=typst}

 ```{=typst}
 #lorem(200)
 
 #lorem(100)
 ```
